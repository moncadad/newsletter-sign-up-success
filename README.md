## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned it's best to keep things neat, labeled, ordered, broken down.
For this project's many parts I figured a function per action would be best.
I don't know if i'll ever remember Regex syntax, but I'm glad its a browser search away!

### Continued development

I'm having fun getting into using javascript. At a first glance it's daunting, but just like many things all it takes is breaking it down.
I look forward to learning Javacript, but also everything when it comes to web development.
